# goakit

The `goakit` plugin is a [Goa](https://github.com/goadesign/goa) plugin that generates
[Go kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) services and clients from Goa designs.

## Usage

Simply import the plugin in the service design package. Use the blank identifier `_` as explicit
package name:

```go
package design

import . "goa.design/goa/v3/dsl"
import _ "goa.design/plugins/goakit" # Enables goakit

var _ = API("...
```

and generate as usual:

```bash
goa gen PACKAGE
goa example PACKAGE
```

where `PACKAGE` is the Go import path of the design package.

## Effects of the Plugin

Importing the `goakit` package changes the behavior of both the `gen` and `example` commands of the
`goa` tool. The `gen` command output is modified as follows:

1. The generated code uses `(github.com/go-kit/kit/endpoint).Endpoint` instead of `goa.Endpoint`
   everywhere the `Endpoint` type is used.
2. `goakit` generates a `kitclient` and a `kitserver` packages under the `http` directory which
   define Go kit HTTP encoder and decoder functions.
3. `goakit` also generates the file `mount.go` in the `kitserver` package which define the same
   `MountXXX` functions as the `server` package for convenience.

The `example` command output is modified so that the example server uses the Go kit logger and HTTP
transport struct (defined using the Go kit encoder and decoder functions generated by the `gen`
command).

## Examples

The [calc](https://github.com/goadesign/plugins/tree/master/goakit/examples/calc) example illustrates
basic usage of the goakit plugin. The
[README](https://github.com/goadesign/plugins/tree/master/goakit/examples/calc) contains instructions to install and run the example.

The [fetcher](https://github.com/goadesign/plugins/tree/master/goakit/examples/fetcher) example illustrates writing multiple
microservices using the plugin and leverages the generated client code to enable inter-service requests.
